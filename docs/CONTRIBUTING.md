## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report:
1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mojahid2021/linux-speed-meter/issues)
2. Try the latest version to see if the issue is already fixed
3. Collect relevant information (OS, version, error messages)

**When reporting a bug, include:**
- Clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- System information (OS, version, desktop environment)
- Application version (check Help â†’ About or VERSION file)

**Bug Report Template:**
```markdown
**Description**
A clear description of the bug.

**To Reproduce**
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '...'
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
What should happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable.

**Environment:**
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04]
- Desktop Environment: [e.g., GNOME 42]
- Application Version: [e.g., 2.0.0]

**Additional context**
Any other relevant information.
```

### Suggesting Features

Before suggesting a feature:
1. Check if it's already proposed in issues or discussions
2. Consider if it fits the project's scope
3. Think about how it would benefit other users

**Feature Request Template:**
```markdown
**Is your feature request related to a problem?**
A clear description of the problem.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
What you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Other solutions or features you've considered.

**Additional context**
Mockups, examples, or other relevant information.
```

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/linux-speed-meter.git
   cd linux-speed-meter
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mojahid2021/linux-speed-meter.git
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Linux
   ./setup_dev.sh
   
   # Or manually install dependencies (see BUILD_AND_TEST.md)
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

#### Development Guidelines

**Code Style:**
- Follow existing code style in the project
- Use C++14/17 standards
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

**Example:**
```cpp
// Good
double calculateAverageSpeed(const std::vector<double>& speeds) {
    if (speeds.empty()) return 0.0;
    double sum = std::accumulate(speeds.begin(), speeds.end(), 0.0);
    return sum / speeds.size();
}

// Avoid
double calc(std::vector<double> s) {
    double t=0;for(auto x:s)t+=x;return t/s.size();
}
```

**Commits:**
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues when applicable
- Keep commits focused on single changes

**Commit Message Format:**
```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if needed. Wrap at 72 characters.
Explain what and why, not how (code shows how).

- Bullet points are okay
- Use present tense

Fixes #123
```

**Testing:**
- Test your changes on the target platform(s)
- Ensure existing features still work
- Add manual test cases to BUILD_AND_TEST.md if applicable
- Run builds successfully before submitting

**Documentation:**
- Update relevant documentation (README, USER_GUIDE, etc.)
- Add comments for new functions and classes
- Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
- Add docstrings for public APIs
